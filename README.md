this is a firework program using plain, vanilla javascript and the canvas element
it is really basic code and is my first project using canvas and javascript, hope you like it!

points:
1. you may comment lines 42 to 48 if you would just like to see a bunch of particles move across the screen
2. you may change the fillstyle to black at line number 124 if you do not want to see trails

either way the output does look quite cool
